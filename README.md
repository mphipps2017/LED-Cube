This is a project I made for a course during my second semester at university.  I think the primary goal of this project based course was for us to go find something that interested us (based on some introductory principles we learned the previous semester) and try to make it.  This project was primarily a hardware based project, but the little code that was made for it is available here.  Note, this was a group project.  I talk more about the hardware aspect of the project here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kblGfuKmfC_O8xDEY9zJQJu3-WiB2PyvPPwlJ8jYkL8/edit
